All sample code used in lectures can be found here.

You should import (in your IDE) the main Java directory as a Gradle project (just like all labs/projects).

You can also execute the main method like: `$ gradle -p dataflow` (execute this inside your `java` directory) or `$ gradle -p java/dataflow` (execute this in your repo's root dir). The `-p` argument specifies the gradle project to be run (in this case, `dataflow`).
